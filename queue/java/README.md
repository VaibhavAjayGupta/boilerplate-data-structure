<p dir="ltr"><strong>Queue or FIFO</strong> (first in, first out) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: <strong>enqueue</strong>, the process of adding an element to the collection.(The element is added from the rear side) and <strong>dequeue</strong>, the process of removing the first element that was added. (The element is removed from the front side). It can be implemented by using both array and linked list.</p>
